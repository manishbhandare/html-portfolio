<p>"Homework," said Fred vaguely. 
  "Don't be ridiculous, you're still on holiday," said Mrs. Weasley. 
  "Yeah, we've left it a bit late," said George. 
  "You're not by any chance writing out a new order form, are you?" said Mrs. Weasley shrewdly.  "You wouldn't be thinking of restarting Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, by any chance?" 
  "Now, Mum," said Fred, looking up at her, a pained look on his face. "If the Hogwarts Express crashed tomorrow, and George and I died, how would you feel to know that the last thing we ever heard from you was an unfounded accusation?" 
  Everyone laughed, even Mrs. Weasley. 
  "Oh your father's coming!"  she said suddenly, looking up at the clock again. 
  Mr. Weasley's hand had suddenly spun from "work" to "traveling"; a second later it had shuddered to a halt on "home" with the others, and they heard him calling from the kitchen.

<p>Jets of light shot from both wands, hit each other in midair, and ricocheted off at angles -- Harry's hit Goyle in the face, and Malfoy's hit Hermione.  Goyle bellowed and put his hands to his nose, where great ugly boils were springing up - Hermione, whimpering in panic, was clutching her mouth. 
  "Hermione!" 
  Ron had hurried forward to see what was wrong with her; Harry turned and saw Ron dragging Hermione's hand away from her face.  It wasn't a pretty sight.  Hermione's front teeth - already larger than average - were now growing at an alarming rate; she was looking more and more like a beaver as her teeth elongated, past her bottom lip, toward her chin - panic-stricken, she felt them and let out a terrified cry. 
  "And what is all this noise about?" said a soft, deadly voice. 
  Snape had arrived.  The Slytherins clamored to give their explanations; Snape pointed a long yellow finger at Malfoy and said, "Explain." 
  "Potter attacked me, sir -"

<p>"Lumos," Dumbledore said, lighting his wand and holding it up. 
Its narrow beam traveled from black trunk to black trunk, illuminating the ground.  And then it fell upon a pair of feet. 
Harry and Dumbledore hurried forward.  Krum was sprawled on the forest floor.  He seemed to be unconscious.  There was no sign at all of Mr. Crouch.  Dumbledore bent over Krum and gently lifted one of his eyelids. 
"Stunned," he said softly. His half-moon glasses glittered in the wandlight as he peered around at the surrounding trees.
